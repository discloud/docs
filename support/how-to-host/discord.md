## ðŸ“¥ How to host your bot <a id="how-to-host-your-bot"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Only host through Discord if your file is less than 8 MB. If it is bigger, it will have to be hosted on the website version.
{% endhint %}

If you are in the **CloudAccess** position, it means that you have successfully registered with DisCloud. To host, enter the canalcommands text channel and type `.up`.
